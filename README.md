# CLI Task tracker (Python)

## Description
This is a practice project which was listed in roadmap.sh:
https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker

Task tracker is a project used to track and manage your tasks using a simple command line interface (CLI).

## Project Goals
The application should run from the command line, accept user actions and inputs as arguments, and store the tasks in a JSON file. The user should be able to:

- [x] Add, Update, and Delete tasks
- [x] Mark a task as in progress or done
- [x] List all tasks
- [x] List all tasks that are done
- [x] List all tasks that are not done
- [x] List all tasks that are in progress

Here are some constraints to guide the implementation:

- [x] You can use any programming language to build this project.
- [x] Use positional arguments in command line to accept user inputs.
- [x] Use a JSON file to store the tasks in the current directory.
- [x] The JSON file should be created if it does not exist.
- [x] Use the native file system module of your programming language to interact with the JSON file.
- [x] Do not use any external libraries or frameworks to build this project.
- [x] Ensure to handle errors and edge cases gracefully.
